# Power System Security Enhancement

All the codes in this repository are related to the enhancement of power system security for real-time system operations. The two main programs in the repository are (1) Main_first_component.m and (2) Main_second_component.m. These main programs utilize several user defined functions/subroutines contained in the repository. MATLAB 2017 and Gurobi (version 9) were used for developing the algorithms. 

Theoretical foundations of these algorithms can be found in the following papers.
